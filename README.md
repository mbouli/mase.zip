My travel photography archive. I am always looking for freelance work!

### 🛠️ TO-DO
- Restructure pages, separate ALL elements into component folders + separate each animation for readability
- Create a function to load all of the images from the public folder instead of manually doing so.
- Create a menu with an about me section and have links there!
- Create functioning progress bar
